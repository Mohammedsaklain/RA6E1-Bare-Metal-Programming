## Aim of this Project: 
To setup clocks, gpio's and to create the gpio driver. Make use of inbuilt push button for input data read with blocking mode.
### Output
Toggles Inbuilt LED when User button(S1) is pressed. The basic switch debouncing logic is adapted to eliminate debouncing effect.


### Theory:

â€¢ All pins except P109 (as TDO of JTAG ports) operate as input pins immediately after a reset, and pin functions are switched by register settings.


### TODO

The UART transmission doesn't takes place here, due to the protection or other safety feature, When we hook up the debugger the program execution at line "R_MSTP->MSTPCRB &= ~(1U << 22);" makes the SCR(related to the uart function) register not accessible, resulting successive changes are not happening.
